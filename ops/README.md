# ops/ — hosting socialnetwork.health on its own droplet

Self-contained provisioning + deploy for the **socialnetwork.health** static
site. Independent of `fellows_local_db` (no shared Ansible roles, no cross-repo
dependencies) so this site can be moved or retired without touching anything
else.

The entire live site is two files from `../public/`:

- `socialnetwork-health.html` → served as `index.html`
- `78e65dce-3229-46b0-be38-02da250aaddc.svg` → favicon/logo, referenced at web root

Caddy serves them with automatic HTTPS (Let's Encrypt). No app build, no Node.

## Layout

```
ops/
  deploy.sh                 # rsync the two static files to the droplet (run as operator)
  ansible/
    ansible.cfg
    site.yml                # bootstrap (common + caddy roles)
    inventory/
      hosts.ini.example     # copy to hosts.ini, set droplet IP
      group_vars/web.yml    # connection: root over key-based SSH
    group_vars/web.yml      # site domain, root, LE email, operator user
    roles/
      common/               # packages, UFW, SSH hardening, fail2ban, auto-upgrades, operator user
      caddy/                # official Caddy apt repo, install, site config
```

## One-time: create the droplet (manual, in the DigitalOcean UI)

1. **Droplet**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, smallest Basic plan, region of your choice,
   add your SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`). Note its **public IPv4**.
2. **Reserved IP**: create one and assign it to the droplet. DNS will point at
   the Reserved IP so the droplet can be rebuilt/moved without a DNS change.

## Provision (connects as root — no sudo password needed)

```bash
cd ops/ansible
cp inventory/hosts.ini.example inventory/hosts.ini
# edit inventory/hosts.ini: set ansible_host=<droplet public IP>

ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml -p collections

# accept the new host key once
ssh-keyscan -p 22 <droplet-ip> >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

ansible-playbook site.yml                 # full bootstrap
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags caddy    # later: re-render Caddy config only
```

This installs Caddy, writes the site config, opens the firewall (22/80/443),
hardens SSH (key-only; root reachable by key), and creates the `rsb` operator
that owns `/var/www/socialnetwork.health`.

## Deploy the site (rsync as operator — no sudo)

```bash
just deploy                                        # from the repo root
# or directly:
SNH_HOST=rsb@<droplet-or-reserved-ip> ./ops/deploy.sh
```

(Or edit the default `SNH_HOST` in `ops/deploy.sh` once the IP is known. The repo-root `justfile`
also wraps provisioning and the live-site check — run `just` to list recipes.)

## DNS cutover (Cloudflare, DNS-only / grey-cloud)

Point `socialnetwork.health` **A** record at the **Reserved IP**, leave `www`
as a CNAME to the apex, keep records grey-cloud so Caddy's ACME HTTP challenge
reaches the origin. Caddy issues the cert automatically on the first request.

## Verify

```bash
curl -sI https://socialnetwork.health/ | head -n1            # HTTP/2 200
curl -s  https://socialnetwork.health/ | grep -o '<title>[^<]*</title>'
curl -sI https://www.socialnetwork.health/ | grep -i location  # -> apex
```

## SSH access & the scanner flood

- SSH is reached via the **Reserved IP** (`170.64.248.173`) on the **standard
  port 22**, key-only (ed25519). The Reserved IP survives droplet recreation.
- A fresh public-IP droplet is hit immediately by an SSH **botnet flood** on
  port 22 (we observed ~90 concurrent connections tripping sshd's MaxStartups,
  making connections flaky). This is blocked at DigitalOcean's edge by a **DO
  Cloud Firewall** that allowlists inbound SSH to the operator IP:
  - Inbound: `SSH 22` ← operator IP only; `HTTP 80` ← all; `HTTPS 443` ← all.
  - Update the SSH source rule if the operator's IP changes.
- We deliberately do **not** move SSH to a non-standard port: Ubuntu 24.04's
  `sshd` is socket-activated (`ssh.socket` owns the port; `ssh.service`
  `Requires=ssh.socket`), and a custom `Port` in `sshd_config` races the socket
  and can lock you out. The DO firewall solves the flood without that risk.

## Notes

- Admin path is the **root key** (Ansible connects as root). `rsb` is the deploy
  operator (owns the site root, key-only). It has a password and is in the sudo
  group, so interactive `sudo` works from the DO console if ever needed.
- Caddy logs go to journald: `journalctl -u caddy`.
- `inventory/hosts.ini` (real IP) and `collections/` are gitignored.
